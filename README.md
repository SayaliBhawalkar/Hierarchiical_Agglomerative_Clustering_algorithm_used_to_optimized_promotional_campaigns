Problem statement
You are the data scientist at a retail company, and the marketing 
team is looking to oplimize their promotional copmpaigns by targeting 
specific customer segments. The goal is to identify distinct groups
of customers based on their demographic information such as age, income,
and spending score.

As a data scientist at a retail company, your primary objective is to help
the marketing team optimize their promotional campaigns. The marketing team 
aims to improve customer engagement, enhance sales, and increase customer 
retention by targeting specific groups of customers with personalized 
marketing strategies.

To achieve this, the company needs to segment its customer base into distinct 
groups based on key demographic features. These features include:

1.Age – Understanding the age distribution of customers can help in tailoring 
promotions to different generational preferences.

2.Income Level – Customers with different income levels may have varying 
purchasing behaviors and budget constraints, making it important to classify them 
accordingly.

3.Spending Score – A score assigned to customers based on their purchasing behavior, 
reflecting how frequently and how much they spend. This helps in distinguishing 
high-value customers from occasional buyers.

The main goal is to identify meaningful patterns in customer behavior and segment 
them into clusters that share similar characteristics. This segmentation will enable 
the marketing team to:

i)Develop targeted marketing campaigns that cater to specific customer needs.

ii)Offer personalized promotions and discounts to the right audience.

iii)Improve customer experience and satisfaction by providing relevant product 
recommendations.

iv)Maximize revenue by focusing on high-value customer segments.

To accomplish this task, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering will be used. This 
clustering technique is particularly useful because it does not require specifying 
the number of clusters beforehand, and it provides a visual representation 
(dendrogram) to determine the optimal number of clusters. By applying this method,
the company will gain valuable insights into customer segmentation, leading to 
data-driven marketing strategies that drive business growth.
